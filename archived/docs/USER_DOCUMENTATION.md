### 5. Data Persistence

Your tasks are automatically saved in your browser's local storage. This means:

- Your tasks are specific to the device and browser you're using.
- Clearing your browser data will also clear your saved tasks.

## Troubleshooting

### Translation Not Working

If translations aren't working:

1. Check your internet connection as translation requires an active connection.
2. The translation service may be temporarily unavailable - try again later.
3. Some special characters or very technical terms might not translate correctly.

### Tasks Not Saving

If your tasks aren't saving between sessions:

1. Make sure you haven't disabled local storage in your browser settings.
2. Try using a different browser if the problem persists.

## Privacy Information

- All your tasks are stored locally on your device, not on any external servers.
- When you use the translation feature, the text is sent to a third-party translation service.
- No personal information is collected by the application.
