b. Mark items as completed
c. Translate each to-do item into a language of user's choice
Technical Requirements:
a. Use AI tools (specifically Claude Code) to develop the application
b. Deploy the application on Vercel
c. Provide a live link to the deployed application
Evaluation Criteria:
a. Ability to use AI to complete the entire project
b. Successfully deploy on a new platform (Vercel)
c. Demonstrate learning and problem-solving skills
d. Track and report total time taken to complete the project
Additional Notes:
a. Use online resources like YouTube, ChatGPT, and Claude for guidance
b. No specific coding language mandated
Focus is on using AI as a development tool The goal is to assess a candidate's
capability to use AI for development, learn quickly, and deploy an application on an
unfamiliar platform.
Deliverables:
● Link to a working deployment
● Link to a public github repository
● Code that is clearly commented
● Documentation including:
○ A complete PRD used to develop the application
○ User & Dev documentation
○ Loom video talking through the app and code base explaining how the
requested functionality operates and why it was implemented in the way
it was.
